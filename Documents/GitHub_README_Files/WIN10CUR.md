# Solving your Windows 10 mouse cursor problems

This directory contains documentation and scripts to try and help you fix your frozen/malfunctioning mouse cursor (mouse pointer, or just cursor) on Windows 10

Note: this guide is incomplete. This is a heavily modified version of the Linux article, which can be seen [here](/Linux/)

## Basic troubleshooting

If it is a one time thing, you can close programs with `alt` + `f4` and you can save your files with `CTRL` + `s` (to save playlists in VLC Media Player, the shortcut is `CTRL` + `Y`) sometimes, the issue may resolve on its own after a few programs are closed. If not keep closing until you get to the desktop and see if it responds. If not, try the tricks below, or reboot your system by pressing `ALT` + `F4` on the desktop, then press `TAB` to select the dropdown, and use the up and down arrow keys until you get to `restart and update` or `update and shutdown` (if you don't have your "daily" forced Windows 10 update ready yet, just look for `restart` or `shutdown`

**You should NOT power down your system by holding down the power button** unless the keyboard isn't responding as well, this should be a last resort) pressing the power button will put the computer into sleep mode (with default settings) so this won't work.

## Common programs

No data to display

## Mouse reinstallation

To reinstall your mouse, try this script in the Windows terminal (normal terminal, PowerShell IDE, or your preferred terminal program)

Note: none of these scripts are available yet. Please help me write this article better.

```powershell
echo ("Data not available");
```

PERMISSION_DENIED

```powershell
echo ("Data not available");
```

Then add the mouse back by using this script:

Note: none of these scripts are available yet. Please help me write this article better.

```powershell
echo ("Data not available");
```
PERMISSION_DENIED

```powershell
echo ("Data not available");
```

Note: this method doesn't always work.

You can see the scripts [here](/Windows/Windows 10/Scripts/)

## If all else fails

If all else fails, a reboot might be needed. If that doesn't work, or you don't want to/can't reboot, always remember that you can use your computer without a mouse. If you have a touchscreen, you can use that to replace the mouse, but you should probably try to learn how to use your computer without your mouse and without touch input.

To open a terminal, press `[::] Windows` + `R`

To switch between programs, type `alt` + `tab` keep pressing until you get to a program you need

To submit information in a web browser, type `ctrl` + `enter`

To close a window, press `alt` + `f4`

You will likely be using the `tab` and `enter` keys very frequently (tab switches to the next available button/element)
