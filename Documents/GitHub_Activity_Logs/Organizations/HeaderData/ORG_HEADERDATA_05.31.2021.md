### Extras

GitHub recognizes B/BCPL source code as Limbo code. I can see this, because these 2 bell labs languages are very similar, and Limbo is more used than B, as B was just a prototype of the C programming language.

I used a colorful B logo to be unique, as the B programming language did not have its own icon.
