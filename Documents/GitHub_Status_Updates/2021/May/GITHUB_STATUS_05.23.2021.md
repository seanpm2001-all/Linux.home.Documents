### Status update: May 23rd 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `02` _(as of May 23rd 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had an very day with development today, and a good day overall.

I focused mainly on documentation work today, and got very far with it. I am now past halfway done with my Organization documentation process, with 103 to go (plus the 10 per day) It took a lot of time today.
 
I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, but I am still not halfway done.

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating my 1 year GitHub anniversary, and my finalization of this organization creation process.

Tonight, I had to install a snap on my computer (youtube-dl) as the apt version was over 1 year and 2 months out of date, which likely was the reason it wasn't working on the past laptop

Today, I also learned more about Ubuntu, and am now less ashamed of using it, although I still dislike the snapcraft system, and the nearly fully-flat interface, but it is still many kilometers better than Windows 10. I am glad that the desktop environment Ubuntu uses (GNOME) maintains some gradient, rather than a depressing and boring flat look like that of Windows 8 and up, Android 5.0 and up, iOS 7 and up, MacOS 10.10 and up, etc. I still await the day that Skeuomorphism returns to relevance.

One cool fact I learned about Ubuntu today was that NASA used Ubuntu as their platform of choice to render the first image of a black hole. I didn't read the whole 6 points Canonical gave, if you are struggling to find a good distribution, that Ubuntu is a good option for new users, and possibly all users. Don't like the interf

I was out of it when I wrote this, sorry. I got a little intoxicated tonight, and I am trying to wrap this work up for the night and go to bed.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was an OK day for development
