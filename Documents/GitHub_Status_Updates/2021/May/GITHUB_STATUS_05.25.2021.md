**ðŸŽ‚ 1 Year :octocat: GitHub anniversary (May 25th 2020-May 25th 2021)**

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had an very day with development today, and a very good day overall. Today was my 1 year anniversary day on GitHub. It wasn't as exciting as it should have been, but it was still a memorable day today for me.

I focused mainly on documentation work today, and got very far with it. I am now far past halfway done with my Organization documentation process, with 61 to go (plus the 10 per day) It took a lot of time today. I am now going to force myself to work in this project a lot less, limiting myself to 16-17 parts per day, instead of todays 35+

I did some actual programming work today regarding WacOS. It wasn't too signicant of a set of contributions in quality, but it served as a stepping stone for me learning the C programming language a bit better, and a better introduction for header files, although a lot of it was a boilerplate and some of it was pseudocode. I started establishing the 5 file systems in WacOS today, the 5 default file systems the user can choose to install are `EXT4` `OpenZFS` `OpenAPFS` `HFS` and `HFS+`
 
I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, but I am still not halfway done.

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I got a lot of socializing done outside today, I am in the process of making a new friend. I have come to note that my humorous smirk is a very valuable part of me, as I have now noted over 4 people can't seem to get enough of it when they see me. More importantly, my new friend has a lot of personality, and we share a lot of interests and beliefs.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

I managed to squeeze Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo documentation in today, I almost didn't have time. I wrote this at 11:22 pm, and I had to be 100% done by 11:59:59:9999

Today was an very good day for development
