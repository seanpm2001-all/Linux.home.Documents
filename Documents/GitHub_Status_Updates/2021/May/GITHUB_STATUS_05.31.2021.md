### Status update: May 31st 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 2 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `359` _(as of May 31st 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_ <!-- COUNTER #1 !-->

:shipit: **Days until GitHub :octocat: organization :atom: daily process of late Spring 2021 :electron: is complete:** `~21` (as of May 31st 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_ <!-- COUNTER #2 !-->

<!-- Counters are now being included by default in status posts. The current limit is 4 daily counters, and 6 counters total. The comment you are reading does not count as a counter. !-->

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time."

I had a decent day with development today, and a good day personally. I have been low on time lately, and I have finally pinpointed it to my GitHub organization work and a lack of multi-tasking, something I should have noticed a lot earlier. I will work harder on spending time with my family while doing this work.

I focused mainly on documentation work today, and got pretty far with it. I got to work a lot later today, and stayed caught up with GitHub organization documentation, minus the 3 missing entries.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 53.5% done, but not too close to being done. It is still expected to take up to June 21st 2021 or longer. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I did many forks today, which took a lot of time, but now an additional mass-language project is up to date with its categorization, so this shouldn't have to be done again for a while. I surpassed 7.2K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

I began learning about the ZenScript language today, a bit obscure with little documentation online, but still popular enough for 1 project to be recommended to me written in this language, and for GitHub to recognize it as a programming language. I am looking into it.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got to have some dedicated laptop time to watch videos today, something I haven't done in over a month. Things are slowly returning back to normal for me. I got more time for this today.

I start with a clean monthly slate tomorrow for the month of June, but I have been dreading the possible consequences of my monthly Tuesday gaming sessions for the past 8 days.

Lately, I have been customizing Firefox a lot more. It has been enjoyable. I also learned about all the customizations I can do to the system monitor today. I made some changes, one was a bit far (enabling all disks to be viewed) and one was easier for me to process (making the CPU graph a 3D graph, rather than 8 different constantly intersecting lines. It also looks a lot cooler.

Today, I did some actual programming work, working on a new backup tool concept known as an app backpack, short for app/program-data backup pack. I also briefly worked on the PrestigePreview software library today, and did some work on getting my audio collection back up to date. I am not completely done with getting my audio collection Git framework back up to date.

I got some work done on the Year in Review project, GitHub is no longer giving me scoped data for the past year before May 31st 2021, so now I have all the images ready. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I managed to have the time to do DuckDuckGo and Marine Biology work, but it was difficult to fit in. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

Today was a decent day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->
