### Status update: May 30th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 2 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `360` _(as of May 30th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_ <!-- COUNTER #1 !-->

<!-- Counters are now being included by default in status posts. The current limit is 4 daily counters, and 6 counters total. The comment you are reading does not count as a counter. !-->

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time."

[See my year in review for Year 1 (May 25th 2020 to May 25th 2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I had a decent day with development today, and a stressful difficult day personally.

I focused mainly on documentation work today, and got pretty far with it. I got to work a lot later today, and stayed caught up with GitHub organization documentation, minus the 3 missing entries. I raised 2 issues today, 1 regarding the 3 missing directories, and 1 for future plans for the project.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 52% done, but not too close to being done. It is still expected to take up to June 21st 2021 or longer. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I did many forks today, which took a lot of time, but now an additional mass-language project is up to date with its categorization, so this shouldn't have to be done again for a while. I surpassed 7.1K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got to have some dedicated laptop time to watch videos today, something I haven't done in over a month. Things are slowly returning back to normal for me.

I got some work done on the Year in Review project, GitHub is no longer giving me scoped data for the past year before May 31st 2021, so now I have all the images ready. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got caught up with the DuckDuckGo and marine biology work today, although I stayed up really late to finish. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

Today was a decent day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->
