### Status update: May 22nd 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `03` _(as of May 22nd 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had an OK day with development today, and a very good day overall.

I focused mainly on documentation work today, and didn't get far with it. I focused heavily on getting my laptop setup again, and I transitioned over from my clone laptop to my original laptop. I have a summary for this whole issue (April 19th 2021 to May 22nd 2021 (1 Month, 3 days))

I have undergone a difficult period in which I was stripped of access to several of my computing resources (most importantly: music, some pictures, and some documents) it started on April 19th 2021 when a Dell repair went wrong and my operating system was unmounted. It is a good thing I had been setting up a backup clone of my laptop since March 31st 2021.

I have gone through numerous efforts to repair and recover the data, and I was able to do so successfully with the help of [Price Computers LLC](http://www.pricecomputersllc.com/) who helped me recover all the data and reinstall the operating system. Huge kudos to them. It would be impossible for me to go on without this fix.

I have recently began to worry about the safety of the data without plugging the hard drive in, and I eventually got the guts to do so, at first finding the data to be possibly corrupt, but later finding out it was all there (the recovered data was placed on a 2 terabyte Western Digital hard drive, formatted with the HFS+ file system. It is a 2 terabyte drive, because the recovery software used duplicated my data, and caused ~900 gigabytes to turn into nearly 1.8 terabytes) further experimentation occurred, and today (Saturday, May 22nd 2021) I have switched back over to my original laptop. I have gotten access back to my music collection, and it has remained stable for multiple days. I also am dealing with software bugs that I know how to fix, and they are occurring less often.

The lesson from this is to never hesitate to backup your laptop before doing a hardware repair, no matter how basic the repair is and how much you trust the person repairing, as things can always go wrong (I was told my laptop lacked a CMOS battery, which supposedly corrupted a part of the BIOS/bootloader when the keyboard was replaced)

This is just a copy-paste of a status from my audio notes, but it is a needed explanation. To signify that I am back on the original laptop, I have put the dock back on the bottom (opposed to the default left side of the screen) and have written notes regarding the laptop.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, but I am still not halfway done. I am close to halfway now. I have been struggling to write a status file for all the organizations, I made significant progress on this today, but didn't reach the halfway caught-up point.

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I still ended up failing on my goal of documenting organizations, meaning I will have to do double the work on this tomorrow.

I got caught up on my marine biology work and my DuckDuckGo image work today. I was 4 days behind.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was an OK day for development
