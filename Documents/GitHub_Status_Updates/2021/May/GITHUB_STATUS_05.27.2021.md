### Status update: May 27th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 2 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `363` _(as of May 27th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_ <!-- COUNTER #1 !-->

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this)

[See my year in review for Year 1 (May 25th 2020 to May 25th 2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a decent day with development today, and a bad day personally.
 
I focused mainly on documentation work today, and got pretty far with it. I am now far past 80% done with my Organization documentation process, with 35 to go (plus the 10 per day) It took a lot of time today. I am now going to force myself to work in this project a lot less, limiting myself to 16-17 parts per day. I did less today, as I didn't have as much time. With Git-image work, I got less than 100 pictures for all 7 games today.

I have been rapidly losing followers lately, it is just an artificial number. I got so used to things that stimulate the mind like commit counts (I need the boost sometimes) but I seem to commonly forget that these don't matter very much in the long run, as quality of work counts better than quantity, and if quality can be done in quantity, then that should be done. I only mention this, as during the process of just creating 3 organizations today, I lost 3 followers. It seemed like I was losing a follower for each organization I created. Not very many people stick around long enough to ask me a question about my projects, so it doesn't matter too much. I have gone from 156 followers to 151 followers in the past few days, still a considerable amount, but mostly an artificial number.

I have noticed that someone is interacting with some of my projects.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, but I am still not halfway done.

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I had a difficult day today emotionally and productively, due to severe schedule shifts and illogical debates. In general, I shouldn't be looking at today as negatively, but the illogical debate really got to me, and broke down my mood. I can't mention what the debate was about until May 14th 2040 or a different date due to privacy and security concerns.

I have further been considering a new phone, as part of my plan on phasing out Android. I am down to 2 options at the moment, a PinePhone or a Librem 5. It is still a lengthy process, for one, I can't make a virtual machine of my current phone yet, as I don't have a laptop or desktop computer with over 512 gigabytes of free space that is stable enough or has the capacity for a virtual machine of this size (just installation and a single snapshot will take at least 256 Gigabytes) I am trying to find out first if I can still do SMS messaging without a SIM card, as I have gone through a ridiculous situation with my SIM card in the past 2 months, with the SIM card failing at least 80 times.

I also started writing a book today regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more)

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

I can't get marine biology or DuckDuckGo work done tonight, I am too tired.

Today was a decent day for development
