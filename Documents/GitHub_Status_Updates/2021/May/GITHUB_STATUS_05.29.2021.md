### Status update: May 29th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 2 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `361` _(as of May 29th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_ <!-- COUNTER #1 !-->

<!-- Counters are now being included by default in status posts. The current limit is 4 daily counters, and 6 counters total. The comment you are reading does not count as a counter. !-->

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time."

[See my year in review for Year 1 (May 25th 2020 to May 25th 2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I had a decent day with development today, and a much better day personally.
 
I focused mainly on documentation work today, and got pretty far with it. I am now far past 99.01% done with my Organization documentation process, with 3 to go (plus the 10 per day) It took a lot of time today. I am all caught up, except for 3 entries I am having difficulty finding.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past halfway done, but not too close to being done. It is still expected to take up to June 21st 2021 or longer. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process. I made significant progress catching up on writing entries today, but now I have found that I can't list 3 organizations, not 2, and not 0. It is going to take some searching to find them.

I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got caught up with the DuckDuckGo and marine biology work today, although I stayed up really late to finish. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

Today was a decent day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->
