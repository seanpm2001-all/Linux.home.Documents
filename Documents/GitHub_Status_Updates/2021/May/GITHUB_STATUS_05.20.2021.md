### Status update: May 20th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `05` _(as of May 20th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had an OK with development today, and a pretty good day today. It would have been better if I stayed productive.

I focused mainly on documentation work today, and briefly did some HTML scripting. Today, one of my big focuses was on recovering data from the external hard drive that was cloned off my main laptop. This has been an ongoing issue since April 19th 2021, and significant progress on recovery was made again today. I have now managed to locate all the files I thought were lost, and I will now backup my devices before doing any hardware technical support from now on. I am not 100% fine from this though, as the files doubled in size. I don't know why, but about 960 Gigabytes of data is now equivalent to about 1.8 terabytes of data. I am wondering if the HFS+ file system has something to do with it, or if it was something related to the backup. I assume it might be due to encoding (likely not an issue with newline encoding with Macintosh (CR) as it is the same in size as UNIX (LF) and still smaller than Windows (CR)(LF) (cheat sheet: `CR` = `Carriage Return` | `LF` = `Line Feed`) I just need to find out what) and smaller  I am still elated to have all of my data back and unharmed. I plan on transitioning back to the laptop within the next week.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, but I am still not halfway done. I have been struggling to write a status file for all the organizations, I made very minor progress on this today due to distractions and focus issues. 

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize.

I skipped marine biology work again today, and wrapped up earlier. I plan on going to bed earlier. I got a pretty decent amount of work done today. I am hoping it isn't harder to do so tomorrow.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a very good day for development
