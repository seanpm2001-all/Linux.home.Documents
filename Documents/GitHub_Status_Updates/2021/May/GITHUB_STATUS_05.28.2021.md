### Status update: May 28th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 2 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `362` _(as of May 28th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_ <!-- COUNTER #1 !-->

<!-- Counters are now being included by default in status posts. The current limit is 4 daily counters, and 6 counters total !-->

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this)

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time."

[See my year in review for Year 1 (May 25th 2020 to May 25th 2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a decent day with development today, and a better day personally, but I dealt with some depression today.
 
I focused mainly on documentation work today, and got pretty far with it. I am now far past 90% done with my Organization documentation process, with 35 to go (plus the 10 per day) It took a lot of time today. I am now going to force myself to work in this project a lot less, limiting myself to 16-17 parts per day. I did more today, and am down to 21-23 entries before being caught up.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, but I am still not halfway done.

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I have made a positive observation today regarding my switch to Linux, even with GNOME (which isn't my preferred Linux desktop environment, KDE is (that is until Skeuowie catches on)) that I have significantly reduced my carbon emission rate simply by switching from Windows 10 to Ubuntu with a heavy desktop environment (GNOME 3) Although not perfect, I have reduced consistent CPU usage from 56-90% to 8-25% simply by switching to Linux. This has an impact on the amount of heat my laptop produces, thus reduces carbon emissions. Now if only I could get rid of human tissue, skeleton/bones, vital organs, and so on, then I would be nearly 100% carbon emission free (kidding of course, I can't do that, obviously)

I also started writing a book yesterday (Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

I got caught up with the DuckDuckGo and marine biology work today, although I stayed up really late to finish.

Today was a decent day for development
