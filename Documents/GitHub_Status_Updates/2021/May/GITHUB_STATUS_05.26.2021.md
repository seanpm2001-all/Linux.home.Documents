### Status update: May 26th 2021

<!-- ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `00` _(as of May 25th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_ !-->

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 26th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this)

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had an very day with development today, and a very good day overall. Today was a far less exciting, but I got a lot done.
 
I focused mainly on documentation work today, and got very far with it. I am now far past 77% done with my Organization documentation process, with 40 to go (plus the 10 per day) It took a lot of time today. I am now going to force myself to work in this project a lot less, limiting myself to 16-17 parts per day. I decided to do more today, so I would be less tempted tomorrow, have a more even number, and better prepare myself for my Thursday schedule.

I did some documentation work on WacOS today, giving documentation for the 5 default file systems the user can choose to install are `EXT4` `OpenZFS` `OpenAPFS` `HFS` and `HFS+` however, I am now considering a 6th default system, `BTRFS` as based on EXT4 research, it seems to be a better fit for many people over Ext4. 
 
I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, but I am still not halfway done.

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I got a lot of socializing done outside today, I am in the process of making a new friend. It wasn't as interactive today, but it was still a nice visit. I am the family privacy associate when it comes to the technical field with limited power. For this reason, despite this being a high profile visitor, I will not be mentioning them by name for at least 1 year.

Today, I saw a DuckDuckGo ad on TV. I believe this may be the start of a huge upscale to the privacy movement, and hopefully people will begin to realize that their privacy is important. I feel it really sticks it to the evil corporation that came before the ad.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I have to go to bed early tonight, I have a lot planned for tomorrow. I have to see a Nutritionist due to concerns about my vegetarian diet (I will probably just get a supplement, nothing else is going to change) along with my usual extended Thursday work, and possibly also go to a birthday party, and do journaling and other work, a pretty busy day. I had to finalize earlier tonight.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

I can't get marine biology or DuckDuckGo work done tonight, I am too tired.

Today was an very good day for development
