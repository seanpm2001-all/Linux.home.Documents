### Status update: May 19th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `06` _(as of May 19th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had a very good day with development today, and a pretty good day today.

I had a longer than expected gaming session this morning that didn't drag on for too long. I focused heavily on documentation work today.

I created 10 more organizations today. I hoped to get closer to finishing my organization goal. I had several new ideas, and now it is at its max estimate of June 20th 2021. I have finally gotten to consistently enjoying doing this, so it should be fine. With the GitHub organization info repository, I made significant progress today and wrote 30 status entries, along with other documentation improvements. I am 25% caught up now (53 out of 212 organizations documented) and I plan to keep doing this consistently until I am caught up. I will have to continue at a faster pace of status files to catch up in 6-9-12 days.

Today, I did more research on the Python programming language, and practiced my new knowledge partially on GitHub via Wikiversity.

I got enough done today, and didn't need to stay up extra late. I still stayed up pretty late though. I hope to make more progress tomorrow.

I skipped marine biology work today, and wrapped up earlier. I plan on going to bed earlier. I hope to try and recover my main laptop tomorrow, and get it functional (as in all data is properly setup) again. I got a pretty good amount of work done today.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was a very good day for development
