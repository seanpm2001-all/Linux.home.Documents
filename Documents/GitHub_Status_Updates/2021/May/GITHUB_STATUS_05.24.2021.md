### Status update: May 24th 2021

ðŸŽ‚ **Days until 1 year GitHub :octocat: anniversary:** `01` _(as of May 24th 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_

[See my year in review for Year 1 (2020-2021)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/blob/master/Special/Year-in-Review/2020-2021)

I had an decent day with development today, and a mixed day overall.

I focused mainly on documentation work today, and got very far with it. I am now further past halfway done with my Organization documentation process, with 84 to go (plus the 10 per day) It took a lot of time today.
 
I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, but I am still not halfway done.

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating my 1 year GitHub anniversary tomorrow, and my finalization of this organization creation process.

I began downloading light-DRM (low level DRM in sites such as YouTube) locked videos on my laptop again, a functionality I have been missing for over a month. My life hasn't been very interesting lately, and I got really depressed today, so it was a bit difficult for me.

I really didn't do very much today outside of documentation. I tried to make a lot of progress on documentating organizations today, which I did, but still at a slow rate. I hope to not repeat todays patterns tomorrow.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation.

I didn't get any work done on the year in review project today. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate.

Today was an decent day for development
