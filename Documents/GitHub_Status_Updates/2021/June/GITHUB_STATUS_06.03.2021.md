:shipit: **Days until GitHub :octocat: organization :atom: daily process of late Spring 2021 :electron: is complete:** `~18-19` (as of June 3rd 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_ <!-- COUNTER #2 !-->

ðŸ“… GitHub consecutive day count: `372` _(As of June 3rd 2021 at 00:12:00 am to 11:59:59 pm)_ <!-- COUNTER #3 !-->

<!-- Counters are now being included by default in status posts. The current limit is 4 daily counters, and 6 counters total. The comment you are reading does not count as a counter. !-->

I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

I had an extremely good mild day with development today, and a slightly difficult day personally. I got a lot of work done in various projects, notably starting a re-introduction into robotics, which I have tinkered with a couple times in the past. I have been developing ideas for robots for a few months now, and I came up with a new idea this morning that I wanted to develop today, which is a robotic penguin that is meant to look like the Tux mascot (Linux) 

For this year, these are the phases I have gone through

```yaml
January: Year preparation
February: Degoogle 2021
March: Discussion and code distancing
April: The race to join 100 commits each era/untitled month
May: GitHub platform month, organization documentation and creation celebration and acceleration
June: Robotics month, and GitHub organization documentation finalization
July: Coming soon
```

Compared to yesterday, I spent a bit more time playing games, but still brushed past it.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 58.2% done, but not too close to being done. It is still expected to take up to June 22nd 2021 or longer. More data was added onto the pile today, and it is now expected to take until June 22nd or later, but this may go up and down due to possible duplication. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I had continuous documentation work to do today and stayed up late. <!-- I had to skip Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo documentation work today.!--> I almost had to skip Marine Biology and DuckDuckGo documentation tonight, but I had the time. I also started a proto-project, a realistic farming game, but one that actually goes through development and doesn't remain a concept. The idea likely won't be developed too much by me, as it isn't very important or interesting to me. I feel like someoneelse  might find an interest in it, but it generally is a boring concept. I had to get the concept out, but also might need to expand on it, or else it will be a complete

I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 7.4K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I didn't get any work done on this goal today,

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got some work done on the Year in Review project, GitHub is no longer giving me scoped data for the past year before May 31st 2021, so now I have all the images ready. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I managed to have the time to do DuckDuckGo and Marine Biology work, and it wasn't too difficult to fit in all of it. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

Today was a decent day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->
