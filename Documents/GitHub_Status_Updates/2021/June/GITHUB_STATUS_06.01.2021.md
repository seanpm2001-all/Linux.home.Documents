I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

I had an extremely good mild day with development today, and a good day personally. I have been low on time lately, and I have finally pinpointed it to my GitHub organization work and a lack of multi-tasking, something I should have noticed a lot earlier. I will work harder on spending time with my family while doing this work.

I had a medical appointment this morning, so I had an hour less time, and I also had my once-a-month gaming session that takes a long time. I managed to make it through and beat the odds by getting everything done still before 12:00 am, June 2nd 2021. I struggled for a bit to decide if I would wrap up Khan Academy monthly data. I had the time, so I did. I had a very productive day, and beat the odds of 8 days of negativity.

I had some breaks today, but not very many, and not very lengthy.

I focused mainly on documentation work today, and got pretty far with it. I got to work a lot later today, and stayed caught up with GitHub organization documentation, minus the 3 missing entries.

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 55.5% done, but not too close to being done. It is still expected to take up to June 21st 2021 or longer. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 7.3K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

My laptop crashed earlier, and again recognized itself as a non-laptop desktop computer. This bug was quickly fixed, but I am not too happy that it crashed.

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I got part 1/2 done today, and now I have to map out and upload the structure of the new slim structure so far.

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I started with a clean monthly slate of progress today, but had difficulties with the monthly gaming schedule, which is now over, and won't be an issue again until July 6th 2021. Hopefully I can make it through the rest of my work OK.

I got some work done on the Year in Review project, GitHub is no longer giving me scoped data for the past year before May 31st 2021, so now I have all the images ready. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I managed to have the time to do DuckDuckGo and Marine Biology work, and it wasn't too difficult to fit in all of it. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

Today was a decent day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->
