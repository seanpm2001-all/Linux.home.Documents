I am still preparing the YIR (Year In Review) for year 1, but I need to keep gathering more snippet data first, as GitHub still recognizes May 25th 2021 to be in the wrong spot (I don't know how to better describe this) <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- New notes:
YIR - May 28th 2021

Can be expanded to and from your GitHub experience Gist
"For a site that changes so rapidly, I am impressed that GitHub hasn't made any major detrimental changes to the site in this time." Nevermind, I have now noticed 3 detremental changes in my first year: highlighting doesn't show commit percentage, x commits behind AXYZ release was removed in the past month, linguist changed location and appearance, other than that it is OK

I had a very good/very mild day with development today, and a very bad start of my day personally, that got better over. Unfortunately, I didn't get to rpboitcs work todau.
For this year, these are the phases I have gone through

```yaml
January: Year preparation
February: Degoogle 2021
March: Discussion and code distancing
April: The race to join 100 commits each era/untitled month
May: GitHub platform month, organization documentation and creation celebration and acceleration
June: Robotics month, and GitHub organization documentation finalization
July: Coming soon
August: Coming soon
September: Coming soon
October: Coming soon
November: Coming soon
December: Coming soon
```

Compared to yesterday, I spent a lot less time playing games, as I enjoyed playing, just not as much today

I created 10 more organizations today. I got closer to my organization goal, and I am now currently past 62.3% done, but not too close to being complete done. It is still expected to take up to June 22nd 2021 or longer. More data was added onto the pile yesterday, and it is now expected to take until June 22nd or later, but this may go up and down due to possible duplication. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got work done today, and had to stay up late to finalize. I am still anticipating the finalization of this organization creation process.

I had a much more difficult day today, and wasn't as productive. I didn't focus on my robotics project today, but wanted to. There were some other projects that needed work

<!--
I also started writing a book recently (on Thursday, May 27th 2021) regarding the concept of preservation that is related to several of my key projects. The book is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and it is going to be released free of charge, like all of my other works. I am currently preparing the release, version 1 is ready, butI just have so many major projects I have to get to first at the moment (organization work, organization documentation work, daily git-image work, software documentation, journaling, audio documentation, video documentation, project Slim (SLIM I of my audio collection) culinary documentation, file sorting, and more) I am now freely creating new documents without restriction, which is a big step of progress for me, as I have been struggling on this goal for over a year. Hopefully soon I can start writing down my childhood stories again before I get too old/someone dies. !--> <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I did the usual forks as of lately today. I surpassed 7.6K stars today (projects I am starring) I am currently considering some new project ideas for when I have more time.

I had a difficult day today, with many health problems due to errors. I recovered and calmed down later on.

Today, when powering up my workstation, I noticed that my laptop did not charge at all last night, which worried me. It wasted lots of time, but did villy chage.

I am going on vacation on July 20th

I did a hard drive backup today, and in the end, I turned the day around, but had some difficulties later on.

I have been working on catching up my audio database framework. I didn't get any work done on this goal today,

I had some motivation and focus issues today. I worked on going to bed earlier, but was still wide awake past 11:30 pm

I gained 2 followers overnight, I am currently up to 166 followers.

I have more new plans for work, and 26 pages of additional notes for stuff to do. I am very slowly also working on going to bed earlier. To

Along with all of this, I did the usual Git-image upload work, and standard end-of-day documentation. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I got some work done on the Year in Review project, GitHub is no longer giving me scoped data for the past year before May 31st 2021, so now I have all the images ready. This project I feel isn't going to be developed at the current rate. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

I managed to have time for DuckDuckGo and Marine Biology work today. <!-- This is a boilerplate, not a counter !-->

<!-- TODO: TIMER, HELLO_WORLD.COFFEE, IMAGES.GENERAL :TODO !-->

Today was a decent day for development. <!-- This is a required boilerplate, not a counter !-->
