### Status update: April 16th 2021

I had a good day with development today, although my world is still being turned upside down by technical problems. My new laptop had its first system crash today, along with other issues.

I did the usual tasks today, but really felt like I wasn't doing enough, I started a few projects today, and hope to get back into my degoogle campaign.

I have gained interaction in the inform programming language and its usage todauy.

I had guests over today, family members.

I have recently learned of Google FLoC and I want to write about it soon.

Today was a good day for development.
