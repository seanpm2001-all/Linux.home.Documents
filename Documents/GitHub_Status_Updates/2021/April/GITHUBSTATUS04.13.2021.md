### Status update: April 13th 2021

Today was a very difficult day for development. Personally, I had sleeping issues, and I have been feeling underappreciated lately. I don't know where to socialize with people who are as into tech as me.

My keyboard completely broke today, the A key came off completely, and putting it back on after cleaning still resulted in issues. I would just use the button under the keycap, but I don't want to break that as well. I had some issues, but I transitioned to my backup laptop, the whole reason we got it was for issues like this. I have had distractions with the backup laptop lately, I have been doing a massive sort of files from Reddit. There are still some steps to get it to be a functional backup and half clone.

On GitHub today, I had a poor day with development and wasn't able to get part 2 work (`GitHub-daily` `Git-images`) done. I also couldn't get very much done today. I got part 1 work done, and worked on a new article repo (year of the Linux desktop) which I put a lot of work into. I didn't get very much done today.

Today was not a very good day for development.
