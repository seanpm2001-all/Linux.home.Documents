# AdVenture Communist session May 8th 2021

I had a very long session today, and was able to rank up to rank 39 today and make some progress in the event. I broke my 2 hour limit and played a lot longer today (over 3 hours) but I still had a different limit (start time of GitHub work) in mind.

## Motherland

I made progress here today, and decided to rank up without completing the last 1 quest, as it would take too long. I made minor progress on rank 39, only completing 2 quests.

## Communist Crusade event

I played the Communist Crusade event today and made it to rank 5, and did not rank to the top 75% but I didn't stay at the top 75% last time either. For this description, I have decided to stop the Cyrillic translations, as they were kind of pointless, and I feel like I will try to have actual full translations instead, which will have the same effect, due to the poor quality of machine translation.

## Overview

See above.
