# AdVenture Communist session May 29th 2021

I had a very long session today, and was close to being able to rank up, but I decided to save time, and do it next session, so I could also complete the final 2 objectives.

## Motherland

I made progress here today, and decided to play for a very long time and made progress. I got a free supreme chest today, and upgraded a supreme researcher card, my first supreme upgrade (level 2 Alf) it significantly sped up progress, and is going to make progress easier for a while.

## Ninja Union event

I played the Ninja Union event today, and made it to rank 4, but didn't go further, as I was low on time and battery, and I normally can't always make it to rank 5 in these events. The rewards aren't really worth it.

## Overview

See above.
