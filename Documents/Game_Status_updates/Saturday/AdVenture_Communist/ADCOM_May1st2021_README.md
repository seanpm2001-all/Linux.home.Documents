# AdVenture Communist session May 1st 2021

I had a very long session today, and was able to rank up to rank 38 today and make some progress in the event. I set a 2 hour limit for myself to this game today, it helped a little, as it gave me motivation to quit over 40 minutes after the limit. The game received a big update recently, and some things were changed.

## Motherland

I made progress here today, and decided to rank up without completing the last 3 quests, as it would take too long. I made progress on rank 38, and made it halfway through the quests.

## Stone State event

I played the Стоне Стате (Serbian this time, not Russian) event today and made it to rank 5, and did not rank to the top 75% but I didn't stay at the top 75% last time either.

## Overview

See above.
