# AdVenture Communist session April 17th 2021

I had a very long session today, and for once in quite some time, I was not able to rank up this week. The quests have been really cumbersome, and I swapped between the Motherland and the Comrade Cowboys event today.

## Motherland

I made progress here today, and could have made it further if I didn't accidentally spend over a billion comrades on something I didn't need. I wanted to go from rank 36 to 37 today, but I was unable to.

## Comrade Cowboys event

I played the товарищ Ковбои event today and made it to rank 5, and ranked in the top 75% Hopefully it can stay there at a stable rate by the time I come back next week.

## Overview

See above.
