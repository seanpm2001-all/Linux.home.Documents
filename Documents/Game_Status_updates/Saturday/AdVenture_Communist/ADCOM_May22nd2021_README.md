# AdVenture Communist session May 22nd 2021

I had a very long session today, and was able to rank up to rank 40. Ranks now require 14-16 objectives instead of 12-14 objectives to rank up. I wanted to have more fun with the game today, but I was busy doing a hard drive transfer, and also trying to save time.

## Motherland

I made progress here today, and decided to play for a very long time and made progres.

## ANew Atlantis event

I played the ANew Atlantis event today and made it to rank 4, and did not rank to the top 75% but I didn't stay at the top 75% last time either. <!--For this description, I have decided to stop the Cyrillic translations, as they were kind of pointless, and I feel like I will try to have actual full translations instead, which will have the same effect, due to the poor quality of machine translation. !-->

## Overview

See above.
