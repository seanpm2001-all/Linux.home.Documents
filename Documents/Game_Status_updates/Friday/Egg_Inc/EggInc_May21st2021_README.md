# Egg Inc session May 21st 2021

I had a shorter session today, but made some progress. I overplayed a bit today, but made progress.

## Dilithium egg

I was still on the Dilithium Egg today, and I made some progress, but wanted to stock up chickens mainly. I am getting close to 300 million, I should reach this goal in the next session.

## Quests

I am getting closer to completing the chicken galaxy quest, which will award me 10000 golden eggs.

## Upgrades

I bought a few common upgrades today, and I bought a few epic upgrades today.

## Population

I used a couple hatchery prisms today along with feed and lots of long presses to add over 40 million chickens to my farm. I should be able to reach this goal in the next session. I am also deciding whether I advance to the prodigy egg or prestige for the first time.

## Events

No event data available.

## Soul eggs

I started using soul mirrors last session, and I used one today. I am now skeptical of how well they work.

## Overview

See above.
