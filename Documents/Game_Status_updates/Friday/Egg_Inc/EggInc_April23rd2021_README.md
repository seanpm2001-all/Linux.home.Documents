# Egg Inc session April 23rd 2021

I had a shorter session today, but didn't feel like I made much progress. My addiction towards this game was cut due to an important meeting today, which saved me from playing this game for hours, that and battery life issues.

## Dilithium egg

I was still on the Dilithium Egg today, and I didn't go very far into it, as progress was slow.

## Quests

I think I ran out of quests (other than the Chicken Universe quest) as 2 quest slots say unavailable, and there is a progress bar at the bottom indicating I already completed most quests. Hopefully more are added, as they keep me playing the game.

## Upgrades

I bought many common upgrades today, but didn't go from Decillion$ to Undecillion$. I got monolith habitats (4x) and an assortment of vehicles of many types, although I didn't finish with this, as it was pointless and expensive.

I bought many epic upgrades today due to receiving over 12000 golden eggs. I maxed out the Silo away time bonus to 3-6 hours (originally 1-2 hours) and bought some other upgrades.

## Population

I used a prism today along with feed and lots of long presses to add over 10 million chickens to my farm. The chicken universe quest is still going to take quite some time, as I didn't reach 60 million chickens today.

## Overview

See above.
