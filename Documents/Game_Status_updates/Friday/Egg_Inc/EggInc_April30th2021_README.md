# Egg Inc session April 30th 2021

I had a shorter session today, but made some progress. I still felt like it went on for too long. 

## Dilithium egg

I was still on the Dilithium Egg today, and I didn't go very far into it, as progress was slow.

## Quests

No new info on quests.

## Upgrades

I bought a few common upgrades today. I maxed out the rest of my vehicles (minus the hyperloop) 

I bought a few epic upgrades today, with 1 upgrade on increasing the internal hatchery rate, and a few upgrades to increase the chicken running speed boost.

## Population

I used a hatchery prism today along with feed and lots of long presses to add over 10 million chickens to my farm. The chicken universe quest is still going to take quite some time, as only made it to 70 million chickens today.

## Events

I played the game during a drone bonus event today. It was extra frustrating when I clicked a building instead of the drone.

## Soul eggs

As a logon gift, I earned 10000 soul eggs today.

## Overview

See above.
