# Egg Inc session April 16th 2021

I had a very long session today. I quelled my addiction and quit a bit earlier but still played for a long time.

## Progress

I quickly skipped past the current egg and went for the Dilithium [sic] egg. I regret accepting the daily gift before prestiging, as it could have helped me out.

## Egg

Again, I prestiged today, and went for the Dilithium [sic] egg. I regret accepting the daily gift before prestiging, as it could have helped me out.

### Dilithium Egg

I made significant progress on the Dilithium [sic] egg today, and made many upgrades. The hyper drones (the fastest ones) are really frustrating to me, as the hitboxes of all the items in the game keep preventing me from catching it most of the time, and I click on the chicken habitat, silo, or other and miss the large rewards.

## Overview

See above.
