# Egg Inc session June 4th 2021

I had a long session today, but made some progress. I overplayed slightly today, but made lots of progress.

## Prodigy egg

I played a lot today with the prodigy egg, and made progress until it became difficult to make more progress, then I focused on getting my buildings slightly more ready for the next session.

## Quests

Quests now reward trophies. I received several new trophies today.

## Upgrades

I bought several common upgrades today, and I bought 1 epic upgrade today.

## Population

I used a couple hatchery prisms today along with feed and lots of long presses to add over 20 million chickens to my farm. The boosts from last session were active due to an event I activated them with.

## Events

No event data available.

## Soul eggs

I started using soul mirrors two sessions ago, and I didn't use any today. I am skeptical of how well they work.

## Overview

See above.
