# Egg Inc session May 14th 2021

I had a longer session today, but made some progress. I overplayed a bit today, but made progress.

## Dilithium egg

I was still on the Dilithium Egg today, and I made some progress, but wanted to stock up chickens mainly. I am still far from 300 million.

## Quests

I am getting closer to completing the chicken galaxy quest, which will award me 10000 golden eggs.

## Upgrades

I bought a few common upgrades today.

I bought a few epic upgrades today.

## Population

I used a hatchery prism today along with feed and lots of long presses to add over 25 million chickens to my farm. The chicken universe quest is still going to take quite some time, as only made it to 121+ million chickens today.

## Events

No event data available.

## Soul eggs

I started using soul mirrors today, they are starting to become very useful.

## Overview

See above.
