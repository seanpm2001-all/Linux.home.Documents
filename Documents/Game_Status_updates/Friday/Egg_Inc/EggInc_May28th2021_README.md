# Egg Inc session May 28th 2021

I had a long session today, but made some progress. I overplayed a bit today, but made lots of progress.

## Dilithium egg

I started the game with everything on my current farm being maxed out. I also unlocked trophies, which replaces quests. After finding that progress was too difficult at this point, I finally leveled up to the Prodigy Egg.

## Prodigy egg

I played a lot today with the prodigy egg, and made progress until it became difficult to make progress, then I focused on getting my buildings ready for the next session.

## Quests

Quests now reward trophies. I received several new trophies today.

## Upgrades

I bought a few thousand common upgrades today, and I bought several epic upgrades today.

## Population

I used a couple hatchery prisms today along with feed and lots of long presses to add over 50 million chickens to my farm.

## Events

No event data available.

## Soul eggs

I started using soul mirrors last session, and I didn't use any today. I am skeptical of how well they work.

## Overview

See above.
