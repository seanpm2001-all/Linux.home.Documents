# Egg Inc session April 30th 2021

I had a longer session today, but made some progress. I still felt like it went on for too long. 

## Dilithium egg

I was still on the Dilithium Egg today, and I made some progress, but wanted to stock up chickens mainly.

## Quests

I am getting close to completing the chicken galaxy quest, which will award me 10000 golden eggs.

## Upgrades

I bought a several common upgrades today.

I bought a few epic upgrades today, with upgrades to the hatchery refill and fill rates, along with some other upgrades.

## Population

I used a hatchery prism today along with feed and lots of long presses to add over 30 million chickens to my farm. The chicken universe quest is still going to take quite some time, as only made it to 121+ million chickens today.

## Events

I played the game during a vehicle upgrade sale today, although my vehicles were maxed out last time, so it was pointless for me. I was much better at catching drones today.

## Soul eggs

As a logon gift, I earned 2 prisms today.

## Overview

See above.
