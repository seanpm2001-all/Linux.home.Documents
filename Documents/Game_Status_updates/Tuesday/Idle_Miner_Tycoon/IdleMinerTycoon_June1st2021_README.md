# Idle Miner Tycoon session June 1st 2021

<!-- I had a shorter Idle Miner session today in preparation of my monthly Idle Miner Tycoon session. I made some progress today, and decided to quit early.

I managed to have a successful short session today. Once a month, and still good and short. !-->

I had my monthly Idle Miner Tycoon session today.

Today, I did gameplay on all mines across all continents (that I have unlocked)

## Start continent

I made progress on the start continent today, and made progress on all the mines. A good strategy is to take money from 1 mine that produces more than another, spend it on the smaller mine, and get a huge boost (I didn't do this again today, I also started on the Ice continent today instead.)

## Mainland

I made 5 new maxed out mineshafts on the mainland gem mine today, and got far with the first 5 on mainland level 8. I tried not to play with this for too long.

## Ice continent

I played for a bit on the Ice Continent today, making progress on all the mines.

## Research

I used 10 research points today for a few upgrades.

## Game issues

The game had no performance issues today.

## Session length

I was able to keep the session short today, so all my time wouldn't be consumed by gaming. I was successful on this this month, although my session was still long.

## Overview

See the top section.
