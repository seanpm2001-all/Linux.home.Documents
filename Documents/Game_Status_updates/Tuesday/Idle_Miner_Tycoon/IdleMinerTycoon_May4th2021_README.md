# Idle Miner Tycoon session May 4th 2021

<!-- I had a shorter Idle Miner session today in preparation of my monthly Idle Miner Tycoon session. I made some progress today, and decided to quit early.

I managed to have a successful short session today. Once a month, and still good and short. !-->

I had my monthly Idle Miner Tycoon session today.

Today, I did gameplay on all mines across all continents (that I have unlocked)

## Start continent

I made progress on the start continent today, and made progress on all the mines. A good strategy is to take money from 1 mine that produces more than another, spend it on the smaller mine, and get a huge boost (I didn't do this today)

## Mainland

I made 5 new maxed out mineshafts on the mainland gem mine today, and made progress for the next session. It is going to take much more time to level up gem mines now due to the monthly session.

## Ice continent

I didn't play for very long on the Ice Continent today, unlocking the Jade mine, the last mine to unlock on t

## Research

I used 11 research points today for 2 upgrades.

## Game issues

In the beginning, I tried to switch islands a few times, and the game kept freezing up. It got better after reaching the mainland successfully.

## Session length

I was able to keep the session short today, so all my time wouldn't be consumed by gaming. I was successful on this this month.

## Overview
