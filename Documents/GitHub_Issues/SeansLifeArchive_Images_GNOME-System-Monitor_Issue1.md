# Data for April 12th and 13th 2021 is missing

I have been having a difficult time with hardware lately, I was completely unable to get data for April 12th and 13th 2021 to my backup laptop due to hard drive and SD card failure issues. Data will have to be uploaded in the future when I have access.

I need to specify this: only end of day data for these 2 days is missing (I am not entirely sure if data for April 13th 2021 is missing)
